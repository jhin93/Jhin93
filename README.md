## Welcome to my GitHub!  

I'm Jinkyung Kim, an international Master's student in the Information Technology course (major: Enterprise Software Development) at the University of Technology Sydney, set to graduate in December 2026.

With over three years of professional experience, I specialize in blockchain and front-end development. My work includes developing and deploying NFT smart contracts to protect the copyright of 3D design assets, ensuring secure and permanent ownership through blockchain technology. I also have extensive experience building responsive web applications using NextJS, ReactJS, and other front-end technologies.

## Mission
My mission is to explore and expand the diverse applications of blockchain technology in everyday life, focusing on strengthening the protection of personal information. I am committed to developing secure, decentralized solutions that empower individuals to maintain control over their data in an increasingly digital world.

## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm a Master‚Äôs student in Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, majoring in Enterprise Software Development. I have over three years of experience in blockchain and front-end development. I specialize in NFT smart contracts for copyright protection and building responsive web applications using NextJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

At CLOVirtualFashion, I developed NFT smart contracts on Polygon‚Äôs main network, issuing NFTs for over 4,000 3D artworks to strengthen copyright protection. I built the CONNECT marketplace front-end, implementing the 'Order' feature and optimizing performance with Lighthouse, achieving scores above 80 in performance and accessibility. I also reduced smart contract deployment errors by 25% using Remix and Thirdweb.

Previously, at Feelway, I created over 20 event landing pages, increasing user engagement by 15% and enhancing mobile responsiveness, reducing drop-off rates by 10%. I‚Äôm passionate about delivering innovative solutions and proficient in Solidity and front-end technologies.

#### Blockchain project: 'Digital Stamp'
'Digital Stamp' feature issues the customer's 3D artwork information as an NFT and transfers it to the customer's wallet.

This blockchain feature was to modify and deploy an ERC-721 smart contract, based on a modified smart contract that was newly deployed on the blockchain main network. Thereby strengthening the copyright of the artwork. The method limits the number of NFT transfers to the smart contract to 1. When transferred to the customer, the number of transfers is deducted to 0, so that it is permanently attributed to the wallet. Even if the customer's 3D artwork is stolen, the record existing in the form of an NFT can claim copyright.
