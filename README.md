During my time at CLOVirtualFashion, 
I contributed to front-end development and blockchain solutions to enhance the company’s services and protect customer assets. My key achievements include:

#### 🖥️ Front-End Development: 
Developed and implemented the 'Order' feature in the 'CONNECT' back-office platform, streamlining the order management process by simplifying and organizing order occurrences. Optimized the main service using Google Chrome’s 'Lighthouse' tool, improving performance and accessibility scores to over 80 in these categories through bug fixes and code refactoring.

#### ⛓️‍💥 Blockchain Development: 
Modified and deployed the ERC-721 smart contract to issue unique NFTs for customers’ 3D artworks, strengthening copyright protection. Implemented a one-time transmission mechanism to ensure each NFT is permanently tied to the customer’s wallet, providing a verifiable record of ownership that enables customers to claim copyright even in cases of artwork theft.

### 2. UI Developer
### FEELWAY (Sep 2020 ~ April 2021)

At Feelway, I contributed to the development and enhancement of a luxury brand trading platform, focusing on front-end development and UI/UX improvements. 

#### 🖥️ Front-End Development: 
My core responsibilities included designing and developing functional pages and event landing pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I collaborated closely with the design team to ensure pixel-perfect UI implementation and responsive design across various devices while maintaining the web environment and user interfaces to deliver a seamless user experience. Key achievements include developing over 20 event landing pages, boosting user engagement by 15% during promotional campaigns, and enhancing mobile responsiveness, which resulted in a 10% reduction in user drop-off rates on mobile devices.

I have over three years of experience in blockchain and front-end development. I specialize in NFT smart contracts for copyright protection and building responsive web applications using NextJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

At CLOVirtualFashion, I developed NFT smart contracts on Polygon’s main network, issuing NFTs for over 4,000 3D artworks to strengthen copyright protection. I built the CONNECT marketplace front-end, implementing the 'Order' feature and optimizing performance with Lighthouse, achieving scores above 80 in performance and accessibility. 

At Feelway, I created over 20 event landing pages, increasing user engagement by 15% and enhancing mobile responsiveness, reducing drop-off rates by 10%. I’m passionate about delivering innovative solutions and proficient in Solidity and front-end technologies.

## 🌟 Projects
### Digital Stamp | Blockchain Copyright protection for User of 3D Graphic Asset Platform 'CONNECT' - [CONNECT](https://connect.clo-set.com)

#### Blockchain project: 'Digital Stamp'
'Digital Stamp' feature issues the customer's 3D artwork information as an NFT and transfers it to the customer's wallet.

This blockchain feature was used to modify and deploy an ERC-721 smart contract based on a modified smart contract deployed on the 'Polygon' main network, strengthening the copyright of the artwork. The method limits the number of NFT transfers to the smart contract to 1. When transferred to the customer, the number of transfers is permanently deducted to 0 and permanently attributed to the wallet. Even if the customer's 3D artwork is stolen, the record existing as an NFT can claim copyright.

## Project Mission
The project's mission is to explore and expand the diverse applications of blockchain technology in user experience, with a focus on enhancing the protection of personal information. I committed to developing secure, decentralized solutions that empower individuals to maintain control over their data in an increasingly digital world.
