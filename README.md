Welcome to my GitHub!  

I'm Jinkyung Kim, an international Master's student in the Information Technology course (major: Enterprise Software Development) at the University of Technology Sydney, set to graduate in December 2026.

With over three years of professional experience, I specialize in blockchain and front-end development. My work includes developing and deploying NFT smart contracts to protect the copyright of 3D design assets, ensuring secure and permanent ownership through blockchain technology. I also have extensive experience building responsive web applications using NextJS, ReactJS, and other front-end technologies.


## Mission
My mission is to explore and expand the diverse applications of blockchain technology in everyday life, focusing on strengthening the protection of personal information. I am committed to developing secure, decentralized solutions that empower individuals to maintain control over their data in an increasingly digital world.

## üöÄ About Me
With over three years of experience in blockchain and front-end development, I have a strong foundation in developing secure smart contracts and building responsive web applications. At CLOVirtualFashion, I developed and deployed NFT smart contracts on Polygon's main network, issuing NFTs for over 4,000 3D artworks to protect copyright. I also engineered the 'Order' feature for the back-office platform and reduced smart contract deployment errors by 25% through automated testing with Remix and Thirdweb.

Previously, at Feelway, I designed and developed over 20 event landing pages, increasing user engagement by 15% and enhancing mobile responsiveness, reducing drop-off rates by 10%.

My technical expertise includes blockchain development with Solidity, Hardhat, and Thirdweb, and front-end development using NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I am passionate about exploring blockchain's potential to safeguard personal data and intellectual property, aiming to create decentralized solutions that empower users.
