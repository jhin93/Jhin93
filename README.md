## Welcome to my GitHub!  

I'm Jinkyung Kim, an international Master's student in the Information Technology course (major: Enterprise Software Development) at the University of Technology Sydney, set to graduate in December 2026.

With over three years of professional experience, I specialize in blockchain and front-end development. My work includes developing and deploying NFT smart contracts to protect the copyright of 3D design assets, ensuring secure and permanent ownership through blockchain technology. I also have extensive experience building responsive web applications using NextJS, ReactJS, and other front-end technologies.

## Mission
My mission is to explore and expand the diverse applications of blockchain technology in everyday life, focusing on strengthening the protection of personal information. I am committed to developing secure, decentralized solutions that empower individuals to maintain control over their data in an increasingly digital world.
